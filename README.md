# MLOps Final Project – Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Maze

## 🧠 Introduction

This project is the culmination of an ML pipeline that allows users to solve a maze using **hand gestures**. The hand gestures are captured by a webcam and interpreted using a trained ML model to navigate through the maze (left, right, up, down). This project is inspired by prior ML coursework and takes it further into deployment, monitoring, and full-stack integration.

There are **three main components** to this project:

1. **Research** – ML experimentation and model training.
2. **API/Backend** – Serving the best model with FastAPI and deploying it.
3. **Frontend** – Visual maze interface, integrated with the API.
